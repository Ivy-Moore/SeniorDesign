# SeniorDesign

Hello All! So here is a github repo for all of our code. This is where we will put all documents such as the project charter but also any code for the project. The template/instructions for the project charter is now in here for us to start working on. Keep in mind it is due October 5th! 

We will meet every Monday for the project. When we start programming I will create a scrum board for us to follow to see who is working on current features and for us to have a a backlog. 

Thank you,
Ivy
