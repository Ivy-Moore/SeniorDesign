# SeniorDesign

Hello All! So here is a github repo for all of our code. This is where we will put all documents such as the project charter but also any code for the project.

Coding Guidelines

Dev will be our develop branch. When you want to create a new feature call it feature/whateverfeatureyouareworkingon
For example:

feature/UI-styleupdates
feature/API-bugfix
feature/DB-tableaddition

Whenever you want to merge a feature in develop branch, have at least one person review your code before merging. If its a major addition, have at least two people review the code.
